## Overview

This repository contains Firefly's Kubernetes Collector, which collects
information from a customer's Kubernetes cluster and sends it to the Firefly
SaaS. This means it is an on-premises component.

The collector is implemented in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) and packaged as an
[OCI image](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec). It uses the official [Go client](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) provided by the
Kubernetes project for the benefits it provides over manually accessing the
Kubernetes API.

The collector is currently implemented as a job meant to be run as a Kubernetes
[CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/). While this means the job's execution interval is at the discretion
of the customer, this provides the ability to trigger the job manually at any
given time without having to restart or add triggering capabilities to a
Kubernetes [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

The collector collects various objects from the Kubernetes cluster and sends them
as-is to Firefly. There is a default list of resource types the collector
fetches, to which more types can be added (or removed) via configuration.

## Quick Start

Firefly's Kubernetes Collector requires:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) v1.15+
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) v3.5.0+

To start using the collector, follow these simple steps:

1. Use the Kubernetes Integration wizard in the Firefly dashboard to create
   an access keypair for a Kubernetes Cluster.
2. Install the collector on the cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh/), with the
   data returned from the wizard:

   ```sh
   helm repo add firefly https://gofireflyio.github.io/k8s-collector
   helm install firefly firefly/firefly-k8s-collector \
       --set accessKey=<access_key> \
       --set secretKey=<secret_key> \
       --set clusterId=<cluster_id>
   ```

The collector's OCI-compliant Docker image is [hosted in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/infralightio/k8s-collector). The image is
built from a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) that uses an Alpine-based Go image
and employs a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) process to compile the collector into a
[statically-linked binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library). The resulting image does not use any base layer,
thus keeping its size as small as possible and improving security.

The image is named `gofireflyio/k8s-collector`.

## Configuration

Please review the [charts/chart/values.yaml](values.yaml) file for a list of
configuration options that can be modified when installing the Helm Chart.
You may wish to modify the "schedule" setting, which controls the schedule for
the collector's execution. By default, the collector is executed once every 15
minutes. This can be changed with a [cron-compatible string](https://cron.help/).

When following the steps in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section above, the wizard will
instruct you to assign a cluster ID for the installation. This is necessary
because Kubernetes does not provide a way to access a unique name or ID for a
cluster, a cluster identifier must be provided to the collector.

The chart provides this cluster ID to the collector via the `CLUSTER_ID` environment
variable. The cluster ID must only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters,
dashes and underscore (spaces are not allowed).

The collector must also be configured with an Firefly-provided access and secret
keys in order to be able to send data to Firefly. These keys are stored by the
chart as Kubernetes Secrets, and provided to the collector via the
`INFRALIGHT_ACCESS_KEY` and `INFRALIGHT_SECRET_KEY` environment variables,
respectively.

The collector's behavior may also be configured and modified via an optional
Kubernetes [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/). The complete list of configuration options
supported are not exposed via the chart's values file, but the resulting ConfigMap
can be manually modified, if necessary.

The list of resource types that are collected by the collector can be viewed
in the `DefaultResourceTypes` variable in [collector/config/config.go](collector/config/config.go).
The collector will also collect custom resources (CRDs), assuming it is provided
permission to do so. You can remove or add resource types to the list by
providing the `addTypes` and `removeTypes` values, which accept lists:

```sh
helm install firefly firefly/firefly-k8s-collector \
    --set accessKey=<access_key> \
    --set secretKey=<secret_key> \
    --set clusterId=<cluster_id> \
    --set "addTypes={secrets,applications}" \
    --set "removeTypes={configmaps}"
```

Note that "secrets" permission is required in order for the collector to collect
information about Helm v3 releases install directly via `helm`.

## Helm
In order to migrate from our old release to the updated one follow the instructions (either auto or manual)
### Auto
#### Prerequisites
This script requires the **jq** package. you can download it using your favorite PM (brew/apt etc.).
To check if you have 'jq' installed, type the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   jq --version
   ```
#### Migration
Run the [migration script](scripts/helm_migration.sh).
Please Update the **FIREFLY_COLLECTOR_NAMESPACE** and the **HELM_RELEASE_NAME** if it's not the default values.
### Manual
In order to migrate from our old release to the updated one please follow the following steps:
1. run the following command and save the values of **accessKey, secretKey, clusterId**
    ```sh
    helm -n firefly get values firefly
    ```
2. run:
    ```sh
    helm uninstall firefly -n firefly && helm repo remove firefly
    ```
3. run the next command. **Please fill with the variables from step 1**
   ```sh
   helm repo add firefly https://gofireflyio.github.io/k8s-collector && helm install firefly firefly/firefly-k8s-collector --set accessKey=<enter your secret key> --set secretKey=<enter your access key> --set clusterId=<enter your cluster id> --set schedule="*/15 * * * *"  --namespace=firefly --create-namespace
    ```

## Development

During development, the collector may be run outside of the cluster without
having to package it in an image, or inside the cluster. It is recommended to
use `minikube` for local development.

### Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/) v1.16+
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) v20.10+
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) v1.18+
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) v1.18+
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) v3.5.0+
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) v1.35+

### Server-Side Notes

The collector sends the collected objects to the Firefly endpoint serialized
via JSON. Requests will be compressed using the gzip algorithm, unless
compression fails, in which case no compression will be used. The server MUST
inspect the contents of the `Content-Encoding` request header to check whether
the request body is compressed or not, and only attempt to decompress using
`gzip` if the header's value is `"gzip"`.

The JSON format of each request is as follows:

```json
{
  "objects": [
    { "kind": "Pod", "metadata": { "name": "bla", "namespace": "default" } },
    { "kind": "CronJob", "metadata": { "name": "bla", "namespace": "default" } }
  ]
}
```

The format of object types themselves is generally consistent, and is
documented [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds).
See [this](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/core/v1#Pod) for an example of the structure of an object of type Pod.

When a request is handled by the Firefly endpoint, it is expected to return
a [204 No Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204) response with no body, unless an error has occurred.

### Quick Start

1. Make sure you have the [App Server](https://github.com/infralight/app-server) running. Create an access/secret keypair
   through the User Management page of the dashboard.
2. Start minikube on top of Docker:
   ```sh
   minikube start --driver=docker
   ```
3. Load environment variables so the Docker client works against the local
   `minikube` Docker daemon:
   ```sh
   eval $(minikube docker-env)
   ```
4. Build the collector's Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t gofireflyio/k8s-collector:<appVersion in Chart.yaml> .
   ```
5. Install the collector via Helm (from the project's root directory):
   ```sh
   helm install firefly ./charts/chart \
       --set accessKey=<access_key> \
       --set secretKey=<secret_key> \
       --set clusterId=<cluster_id>
   ```
6. While the collector will now be automatically triggered every 15 minutes,
   you can also run it out-of-cluster at will, directly from the code. Simply
   execute:
   ```sh
   FIREFLY_ACCESS_KEY=<accessKey> FIREFLY_SECRET_KEY=<secretKey> \
       go run main.go \
       -external ~/.kube/config \
       -config `pwd`/.config \
       -debug \
       <clusterId>
   ```
   Note that you must first create a ".config" directory in the project root,
   and at the very least store the API endpoint in a file called ".config/endpoint".
   Other configuration options can be included as well.
   You can also provide the `-dry-run` flag to prevent any communication with
   Firefly (when used, access and secret keys need not be provided).
7. Inspect the job using the command line or the minikube dashboard:
   ```sh
   minikube dashboard
   ```
8. Cleanup:
   ```sh
   helm uninstall firefly
   eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
   ```

### Unit Tests and Static Code Analysis

The collector includes standard Go unit tests, and uses [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) to run a
comprehensive suite of static code analysis tools. The GitHub repository is set-up
to compile the collector, run the unit tests and execute the static code analysis
tools on every commit. The Dockerfile is also set-up to do the same thing when
building the image.

Locally, these steps can be executed like so:

```sh
$ go build
$ go test ./...
$ golangci-lint run ./...
```

### Updating the Helm Chart

The project's Helm chart is located within this repository itself, in the
charts/chart directory, which is served via GitHub Pages (branch `gh-pages`).

To release a new version of the chart, follow these directions:

1. Perform changes to the collector's source code, if any.
2. Update charts/chart/Chart.yaml by modifying the values of "version" and
   "appVersion" to new version numbers.
3. Commit and push to the repository.
4. An automated workflow will trigger, that creates a release & updates the
   GitHub Pages at the `gh-pages` branch.
5. Manually run the "Build K8s Collector Image" workflow, providing it a tag
   whose value is the new version number you've used in Chart.yaml.

### Adding Collection of More Kubernetes Resource Types

There are three locations where one should add a new resource type, if we want
to collect more types by default:

1. To the `DefaultResourceTypes` slice in [collector/config/config.go](config.go).
2. To the `$resources` list in [charts/chart/templates/clusterrole.yaml](clusterrole.yaml).
3. To the `$resources` list in [charts/chart/templates/configmap.yaml](configmap.yaml).
